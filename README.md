# Themepark Finder
## Interactive Front-End Milestone Project 2 

Themepark Finder is a website created with HTML, CSS and JS utilising the Google Maps API to allow a user to search for an amusement, themepark and accommodation and view additional information about that park.

THe website was created to enable a visitor to search, view and plan a trip (vacation) to a amusement or themepark in the United kingdom.


 
## UX
 
The website was created as a single page that is split over 4 pages (landing page, about us, carosel, Google Map with some filtering and results and a contact form to allow a visitor to the site to make enquiries)

As a user to the site:
- As a visitor, I want to perform an action, so that I can achieve a goal.
- As a visitor, I want to be able to search for a city in the United Kingdom and see a list of themeparks.
- As a visitor, I want to be able to search for a city in the United Kingdom and see a list of corresponding hotels.
- As a visitor, I want to be able to filter the search results between themeparks and hotels.
- As a visitor, I want to be able to find additionl inforamtion about a themepark or hotel by selecting the name from search results.


### Wireframes


## Features

In this section, you should go over the different parts of your project, and describe each in a sentence or so.
 
### Existing Features
- Feature 1 - allows users X to achieve Y, by having them fill out Z
- ...

For some/all of your features, you may choose to reference the specific project files that implement them, although this is entirely optional.

In addition, you may also use this section to discuss plans for additional features to be implemented in the future:

### Features to Implement
- Enhancemens to the search function.
- Add additional countries to expand coverage.
- Add additional filters and navigation.
- Add FAQ and additioanl page with information about different themeparks and their attractions.
- Add function to allow visitors to submit reviews, recommendations and tips.


## Technologies Used

This website uses HTML, CSS and JS programming languages.

- [Gitpod](https://www.https://www.gitpod.io/) IDE Editor
- [Bootstrap](https://www.https://getbootstrap.com/) The project uses **Bootstrap 4** to create a responsive website.
- [Bootstrap 4 with CDN Boilerplate extension](https://www.https://github.com/Eventyret/vscode-bcdn/) to provide Bootstrap 4 starter template. With Jquery, popper.js and Font-Awesome 5
- [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/) The project uses **Google fonts** to style the website fonts.



## Testing

In this section, you need to convince the assessor that you have conducted enough testing to legitimately believe that the site works well. Essentially, in this part you will want to go over all of your user stories from the UX section and ensure that they all work as intended, with the project providing an easy and straightforward way for the users to achieve their goals.

Whenever it is feasible, prefer to automate your tests, and if you've done so, provide a brief explanation of your approach, link to the test file(s) and explain how to run them.

For any scenarios that have not been automated, test the user stories manually and provide as much detail as is relevant. A particularly useful form for describing your testing process is via scenarios, such as:

1. Contact form:
    1. Go to the "Contact Us" page
    2. Try to submit the empty form and verify that an error message about the required fields appears
    3. Try to submit the form with an invalid email address and verify that a relevant error message appears
    4. Try to submit the form with all inputs valid and verify that a success message appears.

In addition, you should mention in this section how your project looks and works on different browsers and screen sizes.

You should also mention in this section any interesting bugs or problems you discovered during your testing, even if you haven't addressed them yet.

If this section grows too long, you may want to split it off into a separate file and link to it from here.

## Deployment

This section should describe the process you went through to deploy the project to a hosting platform (e.g. GitHub Pages or Heroku).

In particular, you should provide all details of the differences between the deployed version and the development version, if any, including:
- Different values for environment variables (Heroku Config Vars)?
- Different configuration files?
- Separate git branch?

In addition, if it is not obvious, you should also describe how to run your code locally.
