# Themepark Finder
## Interactive Front-End Milestone Project 2 

Themepark Finder is a website created with HTML, CSS and JS utilising the Google Maps API to allow a user to search for an amusement, theme park and accommodation and view additional information about that park.

The website was created to enable a visitor to search, view and plan a trip (vacation) to an amusement or theme park in the United Kingdom.


 
## UX
 
The website was created as a single page that is split over 4 pages (landing page, about us, carousel, Google Map with some filtering and results and a contact form to allow a visitor to the site to make enquiries)

As a user to the site:
- As a visitor, I want to perform an action, so that I can achieve a goal.
- As a visitor, I want to be able to search for a city in the United Kingdom and see a list of themeparks.
- As a visitor, I want to be able to search for a city in the United Kingdom and see a list of corresponding hotels.
- As a visitor, I want to be able to filter the search results between themeparks and hotels.
- As a visitor, I want to be able to find additional information about a theme park or hotel by selecting the name from search results.

This website uses HTML, CSS and JS programming languages.

- [Gitpod](https://www.https://www.gitpod.io/) IDE Editor
- [Bootstrap](https://www.https://getbootstrap.com/) The project uses **Bootstrap 4** to create a responsive website.
- [Bootstrap 4 with CDN Boilerplate extension](https://www.https://github.com/Eventyret/vscode-bcdn/) to provide Bootstrap 4 starter template. With jQuery, popper.js and Font-Awesome 5
- [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/) The project uses **Google fonts** to style the website fonts.



## Testing

For this project I checked to ensure the website would work with 3 popular web browsers Chrome, Firefox and Edge (although this will be deprecated)
To check the website is responsive and sizes correctly deepening on the size of the browser window.

1. Website navigation and functionality 
    1. Try to click on each button in the navigation menu and that each button links to the relevant section (About Us Find/Google Map and Contact form).
    2. Try to submit the empty form and verify that an error message about the required fields appears
    3. Try to submit an invalid city in the UK and only shows an overview map of the United Kingdom.
    4. Try to submit the form with all inputs valid and verify that a success message appears.
    5. Try to enter a UK city name, such as London, Manchester, Blackpool and the map populates with locations.
    6. Try and click on the amusement button and 

- Interesting bugs or problems you discovered during your testing.
    - Testing the contact form - the required fields are not working as intended and am troubling shooting this. (this is likely an issue with the html tags)
    
- The developer used **W3C CSS Validation Service** and **W3C  Markup Validation Service** to check the validity of the website code.
    - [W3C CSS validation](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/)
